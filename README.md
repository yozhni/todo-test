#   todo-test

Hi! this is simple test project Cucumber+Java

##prepare
If you happily use IntelliJ IDEA:
just choose in menu File - > New -> Open a new project from version control 
sync all of dependencies
choose  in menu File -> Project structure
navigate to SDKs and choose ‘openjdk-18’
if  there is no ‘openjdk-18’ press ‘+’ and download 

If you don't have IntelliJ IDEA, don't worry it's easy to install.
In IntelliJ IDEA choose File -> Settings -> Plugins and install gherkin and cucumber plugins
Open project as described above

If it's not your option - there is the way:
Install maven and don’t forget about java jdk 18

##Run
All you need is just execute:
mvn compile
mvn test
